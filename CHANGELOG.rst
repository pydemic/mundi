Roadmap
-------

Mundi is still alpha-quality library and is full of bugs and the API isn't stable yet. That said, it
is already usable and it is used in production in a few projects of mine. The best way to make it
stable is to get involved and help me smoothing the rough edges.

1.0.x
=====

* Stabilize API


Backlog
=======

Implementing any of the features bellow will produce a new minor version. Most of them would be new plugins.

* Include geographic data and integrate with geopandas.
* Include data from CIA fact book.
* Integrate with data listings from Wikipedia.
* Include data from World Bank.
* Read country data from ISO instead of Pycountry.
* Integrate data with IBGE (Brazilian geographic institute) with mundi as a plugin.
