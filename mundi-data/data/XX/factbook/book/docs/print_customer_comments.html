It was a fantastic mixture of geographical information and excellent analysis.</li><li>I wanted to thank you for everything you do, for this website. The site alone takes a lot of work to maintain, not to mention what you contribute to this country every day. I came across this site by accident.

[An Indian visitor]</li><li>I am a HUGE fan of your agency's <em>World Factbook</em> and seem to find myself spending a fair amount of time every few weeks or so reading the information contained therein.</li><li>I just want to thank everyone there for the fantastic <em>World Factbook</em>. This is an incredible resource.

Thank you.</li><li>I am emailing to let you know that the <em>The World Factbook</em> you provide as part of the cia.gov website is a great source of information and I appreciate it on a daily basis. I am the International Sales Manager for a skateboard company based in Carlsbad, California so the type, quality, and quantity of information you provide in <em>The World Factbook</em> is a major asset to my daily life. I also frequently travel internationally for business and pleasure so it is nice to be able to look into the facts of my destination before setting off on my travels. Thank you for your time and for providing this much needed information.</li><li>Every time I come to your site and <em>Factbook</em> I am compelled to tell you what a hell of a good job you do at providing this information to the public at large.

Your <em>World Factbook</em> is excellent with populations and demographics, politics, and economic info.</p><p>I often go to the US for a holiday to see my relatives there. I love travelling to the States, shopping there and holidaying. I hope to go again next year. I wish your country all the very best.</p><p>Thanks once again. [An Australian visitor]</p></li><li>I just wanted to say you have a great site!</p></li><li>I think the biggest improvement is being able to hover over the continents and see the country names appear. It really helps to see a country's neighbour and relative position.</li><li>Thank you CIA and web master for maintaining this excellent website. It is exceptionally important to me as one of my most valued links when teaching Comparative Politics and World Politics to my students.</li><li>By the way, it [<em>The World Factbook</em>] is an incredible resource work, and should be in every grade school and high school classroom in the country.

[A Norwegian visitor]</li><li>I got to your website by accident, when looking for information on Belize. Then I got curious and went to look on Portugal, my country. I know you get a lot of stuff to read but, in a world that is always thinking of CIA as a non-trustful organization, I really must congratulate you on the FACTS and fact-oriented analysis on Portugal. Much better and clearer than the info from IMF or the UN and many others.  I just wanted to congratulate you for the info on the countries. [A Portuguese visitor]</li><li>At Utah State University, I worked on an intensive and immersive undergraduate study abroad program for travel to developing countries with cultures very different from the US. In such challenging situations, developing cultural navigation skills is crucial for a successful experience. <em>The World Factbook</em> was initially useful for preparing undergraduates in learning facts about a country. Subsequently, it proved important for giving clues about the direction and nature of cultural differences one could expect upon entering a non-cosmopolitan setting. There is little available in the market for helping students think beyond a "Lonely Planet" shopping list of cultural differences; <em>The World Factbook</em> filled this niche.</li><li>Wanted to compliment you on the excellent web site you have been maintaining in <em>The World Factbook</em>. The information compiled, particularly on the current status of North Korea, is very, very well done. It takes special talents of special people to boil so much information down into what you have produced, which is readily understandable by the public consumer.<p>Thank you, on behalf of this one reader.</p><p>I also feel confident that if your staff and field personnel are working with the same kind of professionalism and integrity, that our country is well served by its intelligence agency in all corners of the world.</p><p>Thanks for your service.</p></li><li>I just wanted to thank you for everything that you do, and for this site. The site alone takes a lot of work to maintain not to mention what you contribute to this country every day. I came across the site by accident. Just being able to go through the library information about each country has really given me a much more clear understanding of the world. I wish more Americans knew about it. Thank you!</li><li>Your effort is probably the most fantastic educational tool on which our tax dollars can be used. Thank you so much for your excellent effort.</li><li>I wanted to express my gratitude for your placing <em>The World Factbook</em> online. It is a great and quick way to get some interesting facts and data. [An Austrian visitor]</li><li>I am an American geography teacher working in China. Your website is of great use to me when I prepare my lessons. Thanks.</li><li>Your website is very helpful to me as a parent during homework time. <em>The World Factbook</em> is an invaluable tool for social studies/geography assignment help. I am going to spread the word to teachers/other parents so they might utilize this awesome website and the multitude of interesting info it contains.</li><li>I really enjoy the <em>Factbook</em> because I've learned so much about countries I didn't even know existed - plus ones I was a little fuzzy on where they were located. Thank you very much! I think this is an invaluable service.</li><li>I love <em>The World Factbook</em> and appreciate the valuable and fascinating reference material that you provide. I look at it all the time. Thank you.</li><li>I want to thank you for The CIA <em>World Factbook</em>! What a fantastic source of information.

Thanks for your hard work on our behalf.</li><li>I would like to thank the CIA for their useful <em>World Factbook</em>. I am a student living in Colorado. <em>The World Factbook</em> has helped me on numerous occasions at school. It recently helped me get a passing grade in my College Geography class. It helped me get an 'A' in my High School Geography class. Thanks for the good grades.</li><li>I am happy to see our CIA on Facebook and Twitter. God bless you all and keep doing what you all do so well in protecting us. Your "CIA <em>World Factbook</em>" has been a valued research resource for me for many years.</li><li>Thank you for maintaining <em>The World Factbook</em>. It is a great reference source for me and many others.</li><li>I teach Geography at a High School in England. The information in your <em>Factbook</em> is extremely useful, there seems to be little else quite like it. Thank you.</li><li>Your CIA Factfiles ROCK! I teach English in the UAE and the students don't know much about the rest of the world. I LOVE this site! Thank you American government!</li><li>I find the CIA <em>World Factbook</em> an unbelievably important asset for both research and general fact checking. Thank you for providing it.</li><li>I wanted to send you a note to let you know that your new website looks wonderful! It still contains the same great, in-depth information but is more compact and easier to navigate. I frequently use the website in my Geography classes and suggest that all my students in Middle School as well as my Community College students search through the information when writing or presenting on different countries of the world.</li><li>I would like the CIA to know that my [high school] students use information from <em>The World Factbook</em> and website when doing their research on Spanish-speaking countries. Thank you so very much for this very effective link. I wish more students were aware of what you offer.</li><li>As a geography, US history, and AP government teacher, I wanted to say thank you for the <em>Factbook</em>. It is an incredible resource that I use in almost all my classes, and in my opinion it is one of the better direct contributions for education that government offers today - besides money, of course. I base projects on the <em>Factbook</em> and encourage students to remember it well - I am sure they will be able to make use of it in college as well.</li><li>Thank you for your wonderful resource. We are using the CIA <em>World Factbook</em> as a reference to standardize codes we use to capture country of birth/territory data.</li><li>I just wanted to let you know that your website is really good and that you helped me to study and hopefully pass my geography test on poor and rich nations. I don't really think that many people know about this website, but I do because our geography teacher showed it to us. So to sum up what I wrote, thanks.</li><li>Thank you for providing such a fantastic and informative site. I've visited with varying frequency over the years but always consider your site a first stop for international information. It's well organized and loaded with demographics, maps, illustrations, and much more. The PDF version is wonderful. I'm grateful to see taxes so well spent.</li><li>We are a high school in Peoria, IL. We have just started a Model United Nations Club here at Richwoods. As a career intelligence professional with the US Marine Corps, I found the CIA <em>World Factbook</em> to be a great starting point for research on countries.</li><li>I think that this website is amazing and very easy to use. I use it for all of my social studies projects.</li><li>Wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for all of your work. The information on your website, especially <em>The World Factbook</em> has been very helpful when working with individuals from other countries.

      <ul><li>Your website is excellent. It provides an indispensable reference for those involved in global political, military, diplomatic, or economic affairs. [US Navy officer]</li><li><p>For us [at the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names, PCGN] the <em>Factbook</em> is an invaluable source of information which is readily accessible and easy to interpret. Knowing that the information contained therein is up-to-date and adheres to Board on Geographic Names/PCGN principles reinforces the authority of such a valuable resource.</p><p>At PCGN we use the <em>Factbook</em> as an important reference when assessing geopolitical information for UK Government cartographic products; the administrative division and transnational issues sections being particularly helpful in these cases.  More broadly, we often consult the country pages when researching information for our briefing papers.</p><p>Furthermore, we are happy to be able to include a link to the <em>Factbook</em> from our website, so that our customers too can easily access this very useful source of geographical information.</p><p>We all hope that the <em>Factbook</em> will continue to appear and be maintained as a useful and reliable source of geopolitical information. [Toponymist, PCGN, c/o The Royal Geographical Society]</p></li><li>I truly appreciate the fact that it [<em>The World Factbook</em>] is "one stop shopping" for most of my data needs. In fact, as a foundation for any international study or research, it is the best place to start. I often go to other sites looking for data or making sure that the data I have is up to date and complete. However, what I often find is that their data is simply a repost of your data and not always up to date. The other thing that I really appreciate is that I can get a great set of time series data for analysis from <em>The World Factbook</em>. Most of my work involves statistically analyzing data for geospatial analysis, looking for trends or predictive variables. I have been very successful due to the availability and completeness of your efforts. [Researcher, US Department of State]</li><li>I would like to let you know how much the CIA <em>World Factbook</em> is appreciated.  It is an invaluable resource for obtaining the most precise and verified information on foreign countries.  I refer to the <em>Factbook</em> often while working on my monographs regarding legal and political developments in Central Asia and in the Caucasus.  The CIA <em>World Factbook</em> was repeatedly cited as the source of original information in my books when I compiled comparative tables on the countries of my research.  the <em>Factbook</em> is especially significant in that it allows one to find figures, names, and dates that are not otherwise available. This publication is an extremely helpful tool for me and all of my colleagues. [Researcher, Law Library of Congress]</li><li><p>I have added some analysis of the geology and geography of a country to several bibliographies I have written for the Corps of Engineers and the federal government in response to a number of recent humanitarian crises. For example, my bibliographies on the geology of Burma (Myanmar) and another one on Somalia included a great deal of information from the CIA <em>Factbook</em> on the geography of those countries, especially the transportation capabilities such as roads, airports, shipping statistics, and other data.</p><p>I have generally found the data in the CIA <em>Factbook</em> to be current, concise and correct, and not usually available (or as easily available) elsewhere. [Researcher, Geospatial Information Library, US Army]</p></li><li><p>Regarding the Cross-Reference List of Country Codes. Kudos for a page that is neat, easy to read, and contains useful information laid out in a logical manner.</p><p>I love that you provide several forms of country coding all on one page, very convenient. Truly, sometimes it is required that I need to cross-reference from one type to another. [NGA GEOINT Aeronautical Intel Analyst]</p></li><li>Our office is standardizing the geographical names in our Minerals Availability System Database, and we decided to use the <em>Factbook</em>'s designations as a standard because of the reputation of your Agency's work. [Minerals Specialist, US Department of the Interior]</li><li>The CIA <em>World Factbook</em> remains the U.S. Government employee's ultimate reference resource, an indispensable tool for my day-to-day requirements.  Of the many calls I receive asking to clarify some point 'what name should we use for this nationality, how long is the border between these two countries, what are the FIPS 10-4 and ISO 3166 codes for this dependency' the <em>Factbook</em> is my first (and sometimes my only) line of reference.  It is convenient, rich in information, and authoritative, and for those reasons and others, it is irreplaceable. [Geographer, US Department of State]</li><li>I was looking at <em>The World Factbook</em> online. The site looks great! It is pleasant on the eyes, and of course, the content is a treasure trove. [Executive Secretary for Foreign Names, US Board on Geographic Names]</li><li>Let me take this occasion to commend the CIA for its excellent and oft-used <em>Factbook</em>. It is certainly widely used here in the [State] Department, as well as by the general public. [Deputy Assistant Secretary, US Department of State]</li><li>My compliments to ... <em>The World Factbook</em> team. I cannot think of a product that I've used more often throughout my career. [CIA Deputy Chief]</li><li><p>The CIA <em>Factbook</em> is the primary source used by researchers and academics who track and try to quantify/qualify boundary and territorial disputes. I have seen any number of studies sponsored by USIP, OES and universities who rely on the <em>Factbook</em>'s Transnational Issues section for current information on the status of such disputes. A search engine search of territorial and border disputes invariably brings up <em>Factbook</em> entries, past and present.</p><p>Just last Monday, while reviewing my Google Alerts bot on borders/boundaries, I found a paper by a Liberian writer/activist, who cited the Guinea-Senegal dispute, almost verbatim, from the <em>Factbook</em>.</p><p>I would hope that your Agency continues in its unswerving support for your valuable publication to provide the US Government with official information on the global community.  As it is vetted through the [State] Department, it remains the unsurpassed authoritative, current, and consistent resource on US perspectives and foreign policy. [Boundary Specialist, US Department of State]</p></li><li><p>By the early 2000s, <em>The World Factbook</em> had replaced various traditional atlases and textbooks in becoming the predominant worldwide authority on current political geography information. Because no other source even approaches the <em>Factbook</em>'s volume of usage and acceptance on the World Wide Web, this publication has, perhaps unintentionally, become one of the US Government's most cost-effective means of affecting information flow overseas under both democratic and autocratic regimes.</p><p>Measured within its purview of political, economic, and demographic overviews, the <em>Factbook</em>'s reach and acceptance as authoritative has become the envy of other far more costly yet far less effective USG information programs. This level of accuracy, completeness, and effectiveness does not come by accident but only by the USG's continued resolve to support the <em>Factbook</em> program.</p><p>It should be noted that in no small manner, the contribution of the <em>Factbook</em>'s cartography is as equally instrumental in worldwide dissemination of geographic knowledge as the <em>Factbook</em>'s text.</p><p>Including both the simpler base maps for each <em>Factbook</em> entry as well as the more detailed regional maps, these public-domain products have, far and away, found more widespread dispersal on the World Wide Web than any other single source of overseas non-navigational mapping. The perhaps unintentional effect again is to assure effective dissemination of the USG's depiction of worldwide political boundaries and nomenclature.</p><p>For researchers needing quick, handy reference material, and lacking multiple computer screens that can be viewed simultaneously, the traditional hard copy version continues to be a valuable and indispensable resource as well.
