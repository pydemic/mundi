Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power and declared himself president in a November 1965 coup. He subsequently changed his name - to MOBUTU Sese Seko - as well as that of the country - to Zaire. MOBUTU retained his position for 32 years through several sham elections, as well as through brutal force. Ethnic strife and civil war, touched off by a massive inflow of refugees in 1994 from fighting in Rwanda and Burundi, led in May 1997 to the toppling of the MOBUTU regime by a rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda and fronted by Laurent KABILA. KABILA renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but in August 1998 his regime was itself challenged by a second insurrection again backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Troops from Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe intervened to support KABILA's regime. In January 2001, KABILA was assassinated and his son, Joseph KABILA, was named head of state. In October 2002, the new president was successful in negotiating the withdrawal of Rwandan forces occupying the eastern DRC; two months later, the Pretoria Accord was signed by all remaining warring parties to end the fighting and establish a government of national unity. A transitional government was set up in July 2003; it held a successful constitutional referendum in December 2005 and elections for the presidency, National Assembly, and provincial legislatures took place in 2006.</p><p>In 2009, following a resurgence of conflict in the eastern DRC, the government signed a peace agreement with the National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP), a primarily Tutsi rebel group. An attempt to integrate CNDP members into the Congolese military failed, prompting their defection in 2012 and the formation of the M23 armed group - named after the 23 March 2009 peace agreements. Renewed conflict led to large population displacements and significant human rights abuses before the M23 was pushed out of DRC to Uganda and Rwanda in late 2013 by a joint DRC and UN offensive. In addition, the DRC continues to experience violence committed by other armed groups including the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, the Allied Democratic Forces, and assorted Mai Mai militias. In the most recent national elections, held in November 2011, disputed results allowed Joseph KABILA to be reelected to the presidency. The DRC Constitution bars President KABILA from running for a third term, but the DRC Government has delayed national elections, originally slated for November 2016, to December 2018. The failure to hold elections as scheduled has fueled sporadic street protests by KABILA’s opponents and has exacerbated tensions in the tumultuous eastern DRC regions.</p></div></div></li><li id='geography-category-section-anchor'><div class='question afr_med' sectiontitle='Geography'ccode='cg'>Geography ::<span class='region'>Congo, Democratic Republic of the</span></div></li><li id='geography-category-section'><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-location\">Location:</div><div id=\"field-location\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>Central Africa, northeast of Angola</div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-geographic-coordinates\">Geographic coordinates:</div><div id=\"field-geographic-coordinates\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>0 00 N, 25 00 E</div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-map-references\">Map references:</div><div id=\"field-map-references\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>Africa</div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-area\">Area:</div><div id=\"field-area\"><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">total:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">2,344,858 sq km</span><span class=\"subfield-note\"></span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">land:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">2,267,048 sq km</span><span class=\"subfield-note\"></span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">water:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">77,810 sq km</span><span class=\"subfield-note\"></span></div><div><span class='category'>country comparison to the world:</span><span class='category_data'>12</span></div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-area-comparative\">Area - comparative:</div><div id=\"field-area-comparative\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>slightly less than one-fourth the size of the US</div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-land-boundaries\">Land boundaries:</div><div id=\"field-land-boundaries\"><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">total:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">10,481 km</span><span class=\"subfield-note\"></span></div><div class='category_data subfield text'><span class=\"subfield-name\">border countries (9):</span>Angola 2646 km (of which 225 km is the boundary of Angola's discontiguous Cabinda Province), Burundi 236 km, Central African Republic 1747 km, Republic of the Congo 1229 km, Rwanda 221 km, South Sudan 714 km, Tanzania 479 km, Uganda 877 km, Zambia 2332 km</div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-coastline\">Coastline:</div><div id=\"field-coastline\"><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-number\">37 km</span><span class=\"subfield-note\"></span></div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-maritime-claims\">Maritime claims:</div><div id=\"field-maritime-claims\"><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">territorial sea:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">12</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">nm</span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">exclusive economic zone:</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">since 2011 the DRC has a Common Interest Zone agreement with Angola for the mutual development of off-shore resources</span></div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-climate\">Climate:</div><div id=\"field-climate\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>tropical;

Ongoing conflict, mismanagement of resources, and a lack of investment have resulted in food insecurity; almost 30 percent of children under the age of 5 are malnourished. The overall coverage of basic public services – education, health, sanitation, and potable water – is very limited and piecemeal, with substantial regional and rural/urban disparities. Fertility remains high at almost 5 children per woman and is likely to remain high because of the low use of contraception and the cultural preference for larger families.</p><p>The DRC is a source and host country for refugees. Between 2012 and 2014, more than 119,000 Congolese refugees returned from the Republic of Congo to the relative stability of northwest DRC, but more than 540,000 Congolese refugees remained abroad as of year-end 2015. In addition, an estimated 3.9 million Congolese were internally displaced as of October 2017, the vast majority fleeing violence between rebel group and Congolese armed forces. Thousands of refugees have come to the DRC from neighboring countries, including Rwanda, the Central African Republic, and Burundi.</p></div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-people-and-society-age-structure\">Age structure:</div><div id=\"field-age-structure\"><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">0-14 years:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">41.25%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 17,735,697 /female 17,446,866)</span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">15-24 years:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">21.46%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 9,184,871 /female 9,117,462)</span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">25-54 years:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">30.96%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 13,176,714 /female 13,225,429)</span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">55-64 years:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">3.63%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 1,472,758 /female 1,625,637)</span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">65 years and over:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">2.69%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 974,293 /female 1,321,297)</span><span class=\"subfield-date\" aria-label=\"Date of information: 2018\">(2018 est.)</span></div><div class=\"category_data attachment\"><span class=\"subfield-name\">population pyramid:</span><a data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#imageModal3626\" class='category_image_link'><img alt=\"population pyramid\" src=\"/attachments/images/thumb/CG_popgraph.bmp?1538604944\" /></a><div class=\"modal fade cntryModal\" id=\"imageModal3626\" role=\"dialog\" aria-label='modal dialog used to display image(s) associated with a field' aria-labelledby='imageModalLabel'><div class=\"wfb-modal-dialog\"><div class=\"modal-content\"><div class=\"wfb-modal-header\">	<span class=\"modal-title wfb-title\">The World Factbook</span><span class='sr-only' id='imageModalLabel'>Field Image Modal</span>	<span style=\"float: right; margin-top: -4px;\">	<button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" title=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">×</button>	</span></div><div class=\"wfb-modal-body\">	<div class=\"region1 geos_title afr_dark\"> 	Africa <strong>::</strong>	<span class=\"region_name1 countryName\">Congo, Democratic Republic of the</span><span class=\"btn-print\"><a href=\"/attachments/images/large/CG_popgraph.bmp?1538604944\"><i class=\"fa fa-print\" aria-hidden='true'></i><span class='sr-only'>Print</span></a></span>	</div>	<div class=\"afr_bkgrnd\">	<div class=\"modalImageBox\">	<img class=\"afr_lgflagborder\"		 src=\"/attachments/images/large/CG_popgraph.bmp?1538604944\" alt=\"population pyramid\">	</div>	<div class=\"modalImageDesc\">	<div class=\"header\"		 style=\"background-image: url(/images/afr_medium.jpg)\">	Image Description	</div>	<div class=\"photogallery_captiontext\">	This is the population pyramid for Congo, Democratic Republic of the.

overview:</div><div id=\"field-economy-overview\"><div class='category_data subfield text'><p>The economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo - a nation endowed with vast natural resource wealth - continues to perform poorly. Systemic corruption since independence in 1960, combined with countrywide instability and intermittent conflict that began in the early-90s, has reduced national output and government revenue, and increased external debt. With the installation of a transitional government in 2003 after peace accords, economic conditions slowly began to improve as the government reopened relations with international financial institutions and international donors, and President KABILA began implementing reforms. Progress on implementing substantive economic reforms remains slow because of political instability, bureaucratic inefficiency, corruption, and patronage, which also dampen international investment prospects.</p><p></p><p>Renewed activity in the mining sector, the source of most export income, boosted Kinshasa's fiscal position and GDP growth until 2015, but low commodity prices have led to slower growth, volatile inflation, currency depreciation, and a growing fiscal deficit. An uncertain legal framework, corruption, and a lack of transparency in government policy are long-term problems for the large mining sector and for the economy as a whole. Much economic activity still occurs in the informal sector and is not reflected in GDP data.</p><p></p><p>Poverty remains widespread in DRC, and the country failed to meet any Millennium Development Goals by 2015. DRC also concluded its program with the IMF in 2015. The price of copper – the DRC’s primary export - plummeted in 2015 and remained at record lows during 2016-17, reducing government revenues, expenditures, and foreign exchange reserves, while inflation reached nearly 50% in mid-2017 – its highest level since the early 2000s.</p></div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\"

destination, and possibly a transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; the majority of this trafficking is internal, and much of it is perpetrated by armed groups and rogue government forces outside official control in the country's unstable eastern provinces; Congolese adults are subjected to forced labor, including debt bondage, in unlicensed mines, and women may be forced into prostitution; Congolese women and girls are subjected to forced marriages where they are vulnerable to domestic servitude or sex trafficking, while children are forced to work in agriculture, mining, mineral smuggling, vending, portering, and begging; Congolese women and children migrate to countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe where some are subjected to forced prostitution, domestic servitude, and forced labor in agriculture and diamond mining; indigenous and foreign armed groups, including the Lord’s Resistance Army, abduct and forcibly recruit Congolese adults and children to serve as laborers, porters, domestics, combatants, and sex slaves; some elements of the Congolese national army (FARDC) also forced adults to carry supplies, equipment, and looted goods, but no cases of the FARDC recruiting child soldiers were reported in 2014 – a significant change</div><div class='category_data subfield text'><span class=\"subfield-name\">tier rating:</span>Tier 2 Watch List - The Democratic Republic of the Congo does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; the government took significant steps to hold military and police officials complicit in human trafficking accountable with convictions for sex slavery and arrests of armed group commanders for the recruitment and use of child soldiers; the government appears to have ceased the recruitment of child soldiers through the implementation of a UN-backed action plan; little effort was made to address labor and sex trafficking crimes committed by persons other than officials, or to identify the victims, or to provide or refer the victims to care services; awareness of various forms of trafficking is limited among law enforcement personnel and training and resources are inadequate to conduct investigations (2015)</div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\"
