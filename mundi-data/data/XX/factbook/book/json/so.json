In 1969, a coup headed by Mohamed SIAD Barre ushered in an authoritarian socialist rule characterized by the persecution, jailing, and torture of political opponents and dissidents. After the regime's collapse early in 1991, Somalia descended into turmoil, factional fighting, and anarchy. In May 1991, northern clans declared an independent Republic of Somaliland that now includes the administrative regions of Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, Togdheer, Sanaag, and Sool. Although not recognized by any government, this entity has maintained a stable existence and continues efforts to establish a constitutional democracy, including holding municipal, parliamentary, and presidential elections. The regions of Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug comprise a neighboring semi-autonomous state of Puntland, which has been self-governing since 1998 but does not aim at independence; it has also made strides toward reconstructing a legitimate, representative government but has suffered some civil strife. Puntland disputes its border with Somaliland as it also claims the regions of Sool and Sanaag, and portions of Togdheer. Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN humanitarian effort (primarily in south-central Somalia) was able to alleviate famine conditions, but when the UN withdrew in 1995, having suffered significant casualties, order still had not been restored.</p><p>In 2000, the Somalia National Peace Conference (SNPC) held in Djibouti resulted in the formation of an interim government, known as the Transitional National Government (TNG). When the TNG failed to establish adequate security or governing institutions, the Government of Kenya, under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), led a subsequent peace process that concluded in October 2004 with the election of Abdullahi YUSUF Ahmed as President of a second interim government, known as the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of the Somali Republic. The TFG included a 275-member parliamentary body, known as the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP). President YUSUF resigned late in 2008 while UN-sponsored talks between the TFG and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS) were underway in Djibouti. In January 2009, following the creation of a TFG-ARS unity government, Ethiopian military forces, which had entered Somalia in December 2006 to support the TFG in the face of advances by the opposition Islamic Courts Union (ICU), withdrew from the country. The TFP was doubled in size to 550 seats with the addition of 200 ARS and 75 civil society members of parliament. The expanded parliament elected Sheikh SHARIF Sheikh Ahmed, the former ICU and ARS chairman as president in January 2009. The creation of the TFG was based on the Transitional Federal Charter (TFC), which outlined a five-year mandate leading to the establishment of a new Somali constitution and a transition to a representative government following national elections. In 2009, the TFP amended the TFC to extend TFG's mandate until 2011 and in 2011 Somali principals agreed to institute political transition by August 2012. The transition process ended in September 2012 when clan elders replaced the TFP by appointing 275 members to a new parliament who subsequently elected a new president.</p></div></div></li><li id='geography-category-section-anchor'><div class='question afr_med' sectiontitle='Geography'ccode='so'>Geography ::<span class='region'>Somalia</span></div></li><li id='geography-category-section'><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-location\">Location:</div><div id=\"field-location\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>Eastern Africa, bordering the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, east of Ethiopia</div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-geographic-coordinates\">Geographic coordinates:</div><div id=\"field-geographic-coordinates\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>10 00 N, 49 00 E</div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-map-references\">Map references:</div><div id=\"field-map-references\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>Africa</div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-area\">Area:</div><div id=\"field-area\"><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">total:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">637,657 sq km</span><span class=\"subfield-note\"></span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">land:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">627,337 sq km</span><span class=\"subfield-note\"></span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">water:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">10,320 sq km</span><span class=\"subfield-note\"></span></div><div><span class='category'>country comparison to the world:</span><span class='category_data'>45</span></div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-area-comparative\">Area - comparative:</div><div id=\"field-area-comparative\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>almost five times the size of Alabama;

Despite civil war and famine raising its mortality rate, Somalia’s high fertility rate and large proportion of people of reproductive age maintain rapid population growth, with each generation being larger than the prior one. More than 60% of Somalia’s population is younger than 25, and the fertility rate is among the world’s highest at almost 6 children per woman – a rate that has decreased little since the 1970s.</p><p>A lack of educational and job opportunities is a major source of tension for Somalia’s large youth cohort, making them vulnerable to recruitment by extremist and pirate groups. Somalia has one of the world’s lowest primary school enrollment rates – just over 40% of children are in school – and one of world’s highest youth unemployment rates. Life expectancy is low as a result of high infant and maternal mortality rates, the spread of preventable diseases, poor sanitation, chronic malnutrition, and inadequate health services.</p><p>During the two decades of conflict that followed the fall of the SIAD regime in 1991, hundreds of thousands of Somalis fled their homes. Today Somalia is the world’s third highest source country for refugees, after Syria and Afghanistan. Insecurity, drought, floods, food shortages, and a lack of economic opportunities are the driving factors.</p><p>As of 2016, more than 1.1 million Somali refugees were hosted in the region, mainly in Kenya, Yemen, Egypt, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Uganda, while more than 1.1 million Somalis were internally displaced. Since the implementation of a tripartite voluntary repatriation agreement among Kenya, Somalia, and the UNHCR in 2013, nearly 40,000 Somali refugees have returned home from Kenya’s Dadaab refugee camp – still houses to approximately 260,000 Somalis. The flow sped up rapidly after the Kenyan Government in May 2016 announced its intention to close the camp, worsening security and humanitarian conditions in receiving communities in south-central Somalia. Despite the conflict in Yemen, thousands of Somalis and other refugees and asylum seekers from the Horn of Africa risk their lives crossing the Gulf of Aden to reach Yemen and beyond (often Saudi Arabia). Bossaso in Puntland overtook Obock, Djibouti, as the primary departure point in mid-2014.</p></div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-people-and-society-age-structure\">Age structure:</div><div id=\"field-age-structure\"><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">0-14 years:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">42.87%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 2,410,215 /female 2,416,629)</span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">15-24 years:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">19.35%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 1,097,358 /female 1,081,762)</span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">25-54 years:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">31.23%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 1,821,823 /female 1,694,873)</span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">55-64 years:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">4.35%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 245,744 /female 243,893)</span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">65 years and over:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">2.19%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 95,845 /female 150,887)</span><span class=\"subfield-date\" aria-label=\"Date of information: 2018\">(2018 est.)</span></div><div class=\"category_data attachment\"><span class=\"subfield-name\">population pyramid:</span><a data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#imageModal3767\" class='category_image_link'><img alt=\"population pyramid\" src=\"/attachments/images/thumb/SO_popgraph.bmp?1538604976\" /></a><div class=\"modal fade cntryModal\" id=\"imageModal3767\" role=\"dialog\" aria-label='modal dialog used to display image(s) associated with a field' aria-labelledby='imageModalLabel'><div class=\"wfb-modal-dialog\"><div class=\"modal-content\"><div class=\"wfb-modal-header\">	<span class=\"modal-title wfb-title\">The World Factbook</span><span class='sr-only' id='imageModalLabel'>Field Image Modal</span>	<span style=\"float: right; margin-top: -4px;\">	<button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" title=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">×</button>	</span></div><div class=\"wfb-modal-body\">	<div class=\"region1 geos_title afr_dark\"> 	Africa <strong>::</strong>	<span class=\"region_name1 countryName\">Somalia</span><span class=\"btn-print\"><a href=\"/attachments/images/large/SO_popgraph.bmp?1538604976\"><i class=\"fa fa-print\" aria-hidden='true'></i><span class='sr-only'>Print</span></a></span>	</div>	<div class=\"afr_bkgrnd\">	<div class=\"modalImageBox\">	<img class=\"afr_lgflagborder\"		 src=\"/attachments/images/large/SO_popgraph.bmp?1538604976\" alt=\"population pyramid\">	</div>	<div class=\"modalImageDesc\">	<div class=\"header\"		 style=\"background-image: url(/images/afr_medium.jpg)\">	Image Description	</div>	<div class=\"photogallery_captiontext\">	This is the population pyramid for Somalia.

Somalia's government lacks the ability to collect domestic revenue and external debt – mostly in arrears – was estimated at about 77% of GDP in 2017.</p><p></p><p>Agriculture is the most important sector, with livestock normally accounting for about 40% of GDP and more than 50% of export earnings. Nomads and semi-pastoralists, who are dependent upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion of the population. Economic activity is estimated to have increased by 2.4% in 2017 because of growth in the agriculture, construction and telecommunications sector. Somalia's small industrial sector, based on the processing of agricultural products, has largely been looted and the machinery sold as scrap metal.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, Somalia's capital city, Mogadishu, has witnessed the development of the city's first gas stations, supermarkets, and airline flights to Turkey since the collapse of central authority in 1991. Mogadishu's main market offers a variety of goods from food to electronic gadgets. Hotels continue to operate and are supported with private-security militias. Formalized economic growth has yet to expand outside of Mogadishu and a few regional capitals, and within the city, security concerns dominate business. Telecommunication firms provide wireless services in most major cities and offer the lowest international call rates on the continent. In the absence of a formal banking sector, money transfer/remittance services have sprouted throughout the country, handling up to $1.6 billion in remittances annually, although international concerns over the money transfers into Somalia continues to threaten these services’ ability to operate in Western nations. In 2017, Somalia elected a new president and collected a record amount of foreign aid and investment, a positive sign for economic recovery.</p></div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\"

and Indian Ocean as a region of significant risk for piracy and armed robbery against ships; during 2017, five vessels were attacked or hijacked compared with one in 2016; Operation Ocean Shield, the NATO naval task force established in 2009 to combat Somali piracy, concluded its operations in December 2016 as a result of the drop in reported incidents over the last few years; additional anti-piracy measures on the part of ship operators, including the use of on-board armed security teams, have reduced piracy incidents in that body of water; Somali pirates tend to be heavily armed with automatic weapons and rocket propelled grenades; the use of \"mother ships\" from which skiffs can be launched to attack vessels allows these pirates to extend the range of their operations hundreds of nautical miles offshore</div></div></li><li id='terrorism-category-section-anchor'><div class='question afr_med' sectiontitle='Terrorism'ccode='so'>Terrorism ::<span
