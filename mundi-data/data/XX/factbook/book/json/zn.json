It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1996, over 60% of the world's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean. Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of the US, Australia, NZ, China, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has led to fluctuations in new drillings.</div></div></li><li id='transportation-category-section-anchor'><div class='question oce_med' sectiontitle='Transportation'ccode='zn'>Transportation ::<span class='region'>Pacific Ocean</span></div></li><li id='transportation-category-section'><div class=\"category oce_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-transportation-ports-and-terminals\">Ports and terminals:</div><div id=\"field-ports-and-terminals\"><div class='category_data subfield text'><span class=\"subfield-name\">major seaport(s):</span>Bangkok (Thailand), Hong Kong (China), Kao-hsiung (Taiwan), Los Angeles (US), Manila (Philippines), Pusan (South Korea), San Francisco (US), Seattle (US), Shanghai (China), Singapore, Sydney (Australia), Vladivostok (Russia), Wellington (NZ), Yokohama (Japan)</div></div></li><li id='military-and-security-category-section-anchor'><div class='question oce_med' sectiontitle='Military and Security'ccode='zn'>Military and Security ::<span class='region'>Pacific Ocean</span></div></li><li id='military-and-security-category-section'><div class=\"category oce_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-military-and-security-maritime-threats\">Maritime threats:</div><div id=\"field-maritime-threats\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>the Inside Passage offers protected waters from southeast Alaska to Puget Sound (Washington state); although the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial waters of littoral states and offshore waters in the South China Sea as high risk for piracy and armed robbery against ships, reports of attacks have generally declined from 2015 to 2016; an emerging threat area lies in the Celebes and Sulu Seas between the Philippines and Malaysia where 42 crew were kidnapped or taken hostage and two killed in 2017; numerous commercial vessels have been attacked and hijacked both at anchor and while underway; hijacked vessels are often disguised and cargoes stolen; crew and passengers are often held for ransom, murdered, or cast adrift</div></div></li><li id='transnational-issues-category-section-anchor'><div class='question oce_med' sectiontitle='Transnational Issues'ccode='zn'>Transnational Issues ::<span class='region'>Pacific Ocean</span></div></li><li id='transnational-issues-category-section'><div class=\"category oce_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-transnational-issues-disputes-international\">Disputes - international:</div><div id=\"field-disputes-international\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>some maritime disputes (see littoral states)</div></div></li></ul></div>"}
