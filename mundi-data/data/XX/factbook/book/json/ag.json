Algeria's primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), was established in 1954 as part of the struggle for independence and has since largely dominated politics. The Government of Algeria in 1988 instituted a multi-party system in response to public unrest, but the surprising first round success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991 legislative elections led the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army began a crackdown on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin attacking government targets. Fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw intense violence from 1992-98, resulting in over 100,000 deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s, and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in January 2000.</p><p>Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA, with the backing of the military, won the presidency in 1999 in an election that was boycotted by several candidates protesting alleged fraud, and won subsequent elections in 2004, 2009, and 2014. The government in 2011 introduced some political reforms in response to the Arab Spring, including lifting the 19-year-old state of emergency restrictions and increasing women's quotas for elected assemblies, while also increasing subsidies to the populace. Since 2014, Algeria’s reliance on hydrocarbon revenues to fund the government and finance the large subsidies for the population has fallen under stress because of declining oil prices. As of December 2018, the country planned to hold its next presidential elections in late spring 2019.</p></div></div></li><li id='geography-category-section-anchor'><div class='question afr_med' sectiontitle='Geography'ccode='ag'>Geography ::<span class='region'>Algeria</span></div></li><li id='geography-category-section'><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-location\">Location:</div><div id=\"field-location\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Morocco and Tunisia</div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-geographic-coordinates\">Geographic coordinates:</div><div id=\"field-geographic-coordinates\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>28 00 N, 3 00 E</div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-map-references\">Map references:</div><div id=\"field-map-references\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>Africa</div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-area\">Area:</div><div id=\"field-area\"><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">total:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">2,381,740 sq km</span><span class=\"subfield-note\"></span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">land:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">2,381,740 sq km</span><span class=\"subfield-note\"></span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">water:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">0 sq km</span><span class=\"subfield-note\"></span></div><div><span class='category'>country comparison to the world:</span><span class='category_data'>11</span></div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-area-comparative\">Area - comparative:</div><div id=\"field-area-comparative\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>slightly less than 3.5 times the size of Texas</div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-land-boundaries\">Land boundaries:</div><div id=\"field-land-boundaries\"><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">total:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">6,734 km</span><span class=\"subfield-note\"></span></div><div class='category_data subfield text'><span class=\"subfield-name\">border countries (7):</span>Libya 989 km, Mali 1359 km, Mauritania 460 km, Morocco 1900 km, Niger 951 km, Tunisia 1034 km, Western Sahara 41 km</div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-coastline\">Coastline:</div><div id=\"field-coastline\"><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-number\">998 km</span><span class=\"subfield-note\"></span></div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-maritime-claims\">Maritime claims:</div><div id=\"field-maritime-claims\"><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">territorial sea:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">12</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">nm</span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">exclusive fishing zone:</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">32-52 nm</span></div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-geography-climate\">Climate:</div><div id=\"field-climate\"><div class='category_data subfield text'>arid to semiarid;

However, about a decade after independence from France in 1962, the total fertility rate fell dramatically from 7 children per woman in the 1970s to about 2.4 in 2000, slowing Algeria's population growth rate by the late 1980s. The lower fertility rate was mainly the result of women's rising age at first marriage (virtually all Algerian children being born in wedlock) and to a lesser extent the wider use of contraceptives. Later marriages and a preference for smaller families are attributed to increases in women's education and participation in the labor market; higher unemployment; and a shortage of housing forcing multiple generations to live together. The average woman's age at first marriage increased from about 19 in the mid-1950s to 24 in the mid-1970s to 30.5 in the late 1990s.</p><p>Algeria's fertility rate experienced an unexpected upturn in the early 2000s, as the average woman's age at first marriage dropped slightly. The reversal in fertility could represent a temporary fluctuation in marriage age or, less likely, a decrease in the steady rate of contraceptive use.</p><p>Thousands of Algerian peasants - mainly Berber men from the Kabylia region - faced with land dispossession and economic hardship under French rule migrated temporarily to France to work in manufacturing and mining during the first half of the 20th century. This movement accelerated during World War I, when Algerians filled in for French factory workers or served as soldiers. In the years following independence, low-skilled Algerian workers and Algerians who had supported the French (known as Harkis) emigrated en masse to France. Tighter French immigration rules and Algiers' decision to cease managing labor migration to France in the 1970s limited legal emigration largely to family reunification.</p><p>Not until Algeria's civil war in the 1990s did the country again experience substantial outmigration. Many Algerians legally entered Tunisia without visas claiming to be tourists and then stayed as workers. Other Algerians headed to Europe seeking asylum, although France imposed restrictions. Sub-Saharan African migrants came to Algeria after its civil war to work in agriculture and mining. In the 2000s, a wave of educated Algerians went abroad seeking skilled jobs in a wider range of destinations, increasing their presence in North America and Spain. At the same time, legal foreign workers principally from China and Egypt came to work in Algeria's construction and oil sectors. Illegal migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Malians, Nigeriens, and Gambians, continue to come to Algeria in search of work or to use it as a stepping stone to Libya and Europe.</p><p>Since 1975, Algeria also has been the main recipient of Sahrawi refugees from the ongoing conflict in Western Sahara. More than 1000,000 Sahrawis are estimated to be living in five refugee camps in southwestern Algeria near Tindouf.</p></div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\" style=\"padding-left:5px;\" id=\"field-anchor-people-and-society-age-structure\">Age structure:</div><div id=\"field-age-structure\"><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">0-14 years:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">29.49%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 6,290,619 /female 5,993,733)</span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">15-24 years:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">14.72%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 3,137,975 /female 2,994,056)</span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">25-54 years:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">42.97%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 9,067,597 /female 8,833,238)</span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">55-64 years:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">7.01%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 1,472,527 /female 1,446,083)</span></div><div class='category_data subfield numeric'><span class=\"subfield-name\">65 years and over:</span><span class=\"subfield-number\">5.81%</span><span class=\"subfield-note\">(male 1,133,852 /female 1,287,808)</span><span class=\"subfield-date\" aria-label=\"Date of information: 2018\">(2018 est.)</span></div><div class=\"category_data attachment\"><span class=\"subfield-name\">population pyramid:</span><a data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#imageModal3582\" class='category_image_link'><img alt=\"population pyramid\" src=\"/attachments/images/thumb/AG_popgraph.bmp?1538604934\" /></a><div class=\"modal fade cntryModal\" id=\"imageModal3582\" role=\"dialog\" aria-label='modal dialog used to display image(s) associated with a field' aria-labelledby='imageModalLabel'><div class=\"wfb-modal-dialog\"><div class=\"modal-content\"><div class=\"wfb-modal-header\">	<span class=\"modal-title wfb-title\">The World Factbook</span><span class='sr-only' id='imageModalLabel'>Field Image Modal</span>	<span style=\"float: right; margin-top: -4px;\">	<button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" title=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">×</button>	</span></div><div class=\"wfb-modal-body\">	<div class=\"region1 geos_title afr_dark\"> 	Africa <strong>::</strong>	<span class=\"region_name1 countryName\">Algeria</span><span class=\"btn-print\"><a href=\"/attachments/images/large/AG_popgraph.bmp?1538604934\"><i class=\"fa fa-print\" aria-hidden='true'></i><span class='sr-only'>Print</span></a></span>	</div>	<div class=\"afr_bkgrnd\">	<div class=\"modalImageBox\">	<img class=\"afr_lgflagborder\"		 src=\"/attachments/images/large/AG_popgraph.bmp?1538604934\" alt=\"population pyramid\">	</div>	<div class=\"modalImageDesc\">	<div class=\"header\"		 style=\"background-image: url(/images/afr_medium.jpg)\">	Image Description	</div>	<div class=\"photogallery_captiontext\">	This is the population pyramid for Algeria.

In recent years the Algerian Government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy, pursuing an explicit import substitution policy.</p><p></p><p>Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 30% of GDP, 60% of budget revenues, and nearly 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the 10th-largest reserves of natural gas in the world - including the 3rd-largest reserves of shale gas - and is the 6th-largest gas exporter. It ranks 16th in proven oil reserves. Hydrocarbon exports enabled Algeria to maintain macroeconomic stability, amass large foreign currency reserves, and maintain low external debt while global oil prices were high. With lower oil prices since 2014, Algeria’s foreign exchange reserves have declined by more than half and its oil stabilization fund has decreased from about $20 billion at the end of 2013 to about $7 billion in 2017, which is the statutory minimum.</p><p></p><p>Declining oil prices have also reduced the government’s ability to use state-driven growth to distribute rents and fund generous public subsidies, and the government has been under pressure to reduce spending. Over the past three years, the government has enacted incremental increases in some taxes, resulting in modest increases in prices for gasoline, cigarettes, alcohol, and certain imported goods, but it has refrained from reducing subsidies, particularly for education, healthcare, and housing programs.</p><p></p><p>Algiers has increased protectionist measures since 2015 to limit its import bill and encourage domestic production of non-oil and gas industries. Since 2015, the government has imposed additional restrictions on access to foreign exchange for imports, and import quotas for specific products, such as cars. In January 2018 the government imposed an indefinite suspension on the importation of roughly 850 products, subject to periodic review.</p><p></p><p>President BOUTEFLIKA announced in fall 2017 that Algeria intends to develop its non-conventional energy resources. Algeria has struggled to develop non-hydrocarbon industries because of heavy regulation and an emphasis on state-driven growth. Algeria has not increased non-hydrocarbon exports, and hydrocarbon exports have declined because of field depletion and increased domestic demand.</p></div></div><div class=\"category afr_light\"
